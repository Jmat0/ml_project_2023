# Exploratory data analysis

-   check for missing values: transform the NA's to 0 when there is no delay
-   around 70% of flights are delayed because of weather conditions: make sure to plot this and talk about it
-   check for the distribution using histograms, boxplots: outliers?

# Dealing with missing values

```{r}
library(here)
airlines <- read.csv(here("data", "2018.csv"))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
airlines <- airlines %>% 
  mutate(FL_DATE_NEW = ymd(FL_DATE)) %>% 
  select(-FL_DATE)
```

```{r}
plot_missing(airlines) # check missing values:
```

By plotting the missing values, we see that we have approximately 80% of NA's for 5 variables: - CARRIER_DELAY - WEATHER_DELAY - NAS_DELAY - SECURITY_DELAY - LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY

We think that they should be zeros instead, to represent a non-delay. It would make sense from our assertion from the introduction, stating that around 15% of flights are canceled each year. We need to change the values to 0, and define them as factors (either 1: delay and 0: no delay)

Furthermore, we have a variable with only missing values: Unnamed..27. We will remove it.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Replace NA values with 0 in selected columns
airlines <- airlines %>% 
  mutate(
    CARRIER_DELAY = ifelse(is.na(CARRIER_DELAY), 0, CARRIER_DELAY),
    WEATHER_DELAY = ifelse(is.na(WEATHER_DELAY), 0, WEATHER_DELAY),
    NAS_DELAY = ifelse(is.na(NAS_DELAY), 0, NAS_DELAY),
    SECURITY_DELAY = ifelse(is.na(SECURITY_DELAY), 0, SECURITY_DELAY),
    LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY = ifelse(is.na(LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY), 0, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY)
  )

# Remove Unnamed 27
airlines <- airlines %>% 
  select(-Unnamed..27)
```

```{r}
plot_missing(airlines) # check missing values:
```

Next, we have to take care of the last 10 variables containing NA's. The range of missing values for all of these variables goes from ~ 1.5 to 2%. They seem to be somewhat connected between each other just like the ones before. Since our variable of interest *Arr_Delay* is part of them, we have to carefully look at their structure.

Let's first explore our dataset containing only these NA's.

```{r}
airlines %>% 
  filter_all(any_vars(is.na(.)))
```

As per their descriptions, the variables *Taxi_out* and *Taxi_in* are related to: *Wheels_off*, *Wheels_on*, *Dep_time* and *Arr_time*.

What we can notice is that most of the Na's in *Taxi_out* will be associated with an Na in *Taxi_in*. This is true for all of the occurrences where there has been a delay.

When a flight has been diverted, we will only have values for *Taxi_in*, as the flight never reached it's destination.

In rare cases, we have values for *Dep_time* and *Dep_delay* and an NA in *Arr_delay* due to a cancellation. In these cases, the flight seems to have been cancelled almost immediately after taking off.

The NA values for *Arr_delay* are due to one of 3 scenarios:
  1) Cancellation
  2) Diverted
  3) The arrival time is the same as the planned arrival time (Therefore, should be 0)
  
Finally, we can see that every time we have an NA for *Air_time*, we will also have one for *Actual_elapsed_time*. It makes sense as the latter is a formula containing the former.
